✅ 1. Hawaii State Judiciary – Hoohiki (Court Records)
URL: https://www.courts.state.hi.us/legal_references/records/hoohiki
Data Available:

Foreclosure filings (civil court records)

Case dates, parties involved, and judgments
Scraping Feasibility:

Uses a search form → you can automate search by keyword (like “foreclosure”) using Selenium

You'll need to simulate form interaction and pagination

Not always structured data, so some parsing required

✅ 2. Hawaii State Department of Taxation – Tax Delinquent List
URL: https://files.hawaii.gov/tax/news/announce/announcements.html
Data Available:

Periodic PDFs or documents listing individuals/businesses with delinquent taxes

Property tax, GE tax, income tax lists
Scraping Feasibility:

Data is in PDFs (e.g., "Delinquent Taxpayer List") → Use pdfminer.six or PyMuPDF to extract text

Then parse names/addresses from the documents

Example PDF: 2023 Taxpayer List (PDF)

✅ 3. Honolulu City Real Property Assessment
URL: https://www.realpropertyhonolulu.com/
Data Available:

Property search by address, parcel ID, or owner name

Shows: ownership, tax amounts, history
Scraping Feasibility:

No direct export — you’ll need to automate the search with Selenium

For known delinquent properties, this is good for enrichment after scraping names from PDFs or notices

URL: https://www.honolulu.gov/budget/property-tax.html
Data Available:

AI-Generated Presentation Binder for Each Property
🎯 Goal
Automatically generate a PDF presentation binder or summary for each property, combining scraped data, contact info, visual maps/images, public records, and AI-written summaries — so you can:

Review the property quickly yourself

Hand it off to buyers/investors during outreach or meetings

Print or send via email with one click

🔄 Workflow
Trigger: After a property is fully scraped and contact info is enriched

Data Assembled:

Address and parcel information

Owner name (and LLC status)

Tax delinquency or foreclosure details

Auction date (if any)

Estimated property value (via Zillow or Redfin API)

Google Maps image and street view snapshot

AI-generated summary:

"This 3BR home in Honolulu is scheduled for auction in 6 days. Estimated value is $720k. The owner owes approximately $19,000 in taxes."

Suggested strategy: “Reach out within 48 hours to discuss quick-sale options.”

🧩 Replit AI Prompt Update
You can now update your full prompt for Replit AI with this:

Property details

Owner info

Visuals (maps, photos)

Status (foreclosure, tax, auction)

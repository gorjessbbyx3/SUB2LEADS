‚úÖ CLEAN, REAL-DATA-ONLY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
üîß 1. Supabase Schema: Investors Table
sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE investors
ADD COLUMN preferred_strategy TEXT DEFAULT 'Unknown',
ADD COLUMN background_report TEXT DEFAULT 'No data available';
‚öôÔ∏è 2. Inngest Job: Detect Investor Strategy (Real AI via Grok)
Trigger: When a lead is created with an investor attached
Process: Analyze the real submitted lead data
Returns: Only Grok-based AI result or ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù (no guessing)

ts
Copy
Edit
// inngest/functions/investorDetectStrategy.ts
import { inngest } from "@/inngest/client"
import { getLeadWithInvestor, updateInvestorStrategy } from "@/lib/db"
import { askGrok } from "@/lib/grok"

export const detectInvestorStrategy = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "investor-strategy-ai" },
  { event: "lead/created" },
  async ({ event }) => {
    const { lead, investor } = await getLeadWithInvestor(event.data.leadId)

    const prompt = `
A real estate investor submitted a lead with the following details:
- Purchase Price: ${lead.price}
- After Repair Value (ARV): ${lead.arv}
- Property Condition: ${lead.condition}
- Uploaded Contract Type: ${lead.contractType || "None"}
- Notes: ${lead.notes || "None"}

Based on these facts, what is the investor‚Äôs likely acquisition strategy?
Respond with one of: fix_and_flip, buy_and_hold, wholesale, subject_to, owner_occupied.
If unsure, respond with: Unknown.
`.trim()

    const strategy = await askGrok(prompt)
    await updateInvestorStrategy(investor.id, strategy || "Unknown")
    return { investorId: investor.id, strategy }
  }
)
‚öôÔ∏è 3. Inngest Job: Run Background Report (Only Real Data)
Trigger: investor/created
Rules:

Try matching known public sources

If no info is found, return only "No data available" ‚Äî no assumptions

ts
Copy
Edit
// inngest/functions/investorBackgroundCheck.ts
import { inngest } from "@/inngest/client"
import { getInvestorDetails, updateInvestorBackground } from "@/lib/db"
import { searchPublicInvestorInfo } from "@/lib/search"

export const runInvestorBackgroundCheck = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "real-investor-background" },
  { event: "investor/created" },
  async ({ event }) => {
    const investor = await getInvestorDetails(event.data.investorId)

    const report = await searchPublicInvestorInfo({
      email: investor.email,
      phone: investor.phone,
      name: investor.name,
    })

    await updateInvestorBackground(investor.id, report || "No data available")
    return { investorId: investor.id, reportFound: !!report }
  }
)
üîé 4. searchPublicInvestorInfo() (Real Data Only Stub)
You‚Äôll integrate this with tools like:

Clearbit (email/phone-based enrichment)

Apollo.io (B2B lead lookup)

Facebook/Craigslist scraping

Any Hawaii REI group data

ts
Copy
Edit
// lib/search.ts
export async function searchPublicInvestorInfo({ email, phone, name }) {
  // Placeholder for real data sources only
  // Implement Clearbit, Facebook group scraping, etc. here
  return null // if nothing is found
}
‚úÖ Strict Fallback Rule:
‚ùå No AI-guessing
‚ùå No mocked assumptions
‚úÖ Only "Unknown" or "No data available" if Grok or real s

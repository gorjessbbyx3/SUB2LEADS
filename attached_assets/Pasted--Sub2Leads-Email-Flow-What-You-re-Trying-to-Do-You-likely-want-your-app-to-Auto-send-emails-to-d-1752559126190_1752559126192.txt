✅ Sub2Leads Email Flow: What You’re Trying to Do
You likely want your app to:

Auto-send emails to distressed property owners.

Pull contact info from scraping or AI (name, email, maybe phone).

Trigger the email via a backend API or CRM event.

Include things like:

A personal introduction

Offer to help sell/save the property

A link to your site or calendar

Optionally: attach a property PDF/binder

🔧 Full SendGrid Setup in Replit (Specific to Sub2Leads)
1. Add the API Key in Replit Secrets
Key: SENDGRID_API_KEY

Value: Your actual API key from SendGrid Dashboard

2. Install the SendGrid SDK (JavaScript/Node)
Run this in the Replit shell:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install @sendgrid/mail
3. Create an Email Utility (utils/sendEmail.js)
js
Copy
Edit
import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail';

sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

export async function sendEmail(to, subject, htmlContent) {
  const msg = {
    to,
    from: 'your_verified_sender@example.com', // Verified in SendGrid
    subject,
    html: htmlContent,
  };

  try {
    await sgMail.send(msg);
    console.log('✅ Email sent to:', to);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Error sending email:', error);
  }
}
4. Create an API Route for Triggering Emails (pages/api/sendEmail.js)
js
Copy
Edit
import { sendEmail } from '../../utils/sendEmail';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method !== 'POST') return res.status(405).end();

  const { email, name, propertyAddress } = req.body;

  const subject = `Reaching out about your property at ${propertyAddress}`;
  const htmlContent = `
    <p>Hi ${name || 'there'},</p>
    <p>My name is [Your Name] with Sub2Leads. I noticed your property at <strong>${propertyAddress}</strong> may be facing financial difficulty.</p>
    <p>I work with investors who help homeowners in these situations — with fast closings and flexible terms.</p>
    <p>If you're open to a conversation, feel free to reply or <a href="https://calendly.com/your-scheduler">book a call here</a>.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br/>[Your Name]<br/>Sub2Leads</p>
  `;

  try {
    await sendEmail(email, subject, htmlContent);
    res.status(200).json({ success: true });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to send email' });
  }
}
5. Trigger From the CRM UI
In your CRM (e.g. lead dashboard):

ts
Copy
Edit
fetch('/api/sendEmail', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: lead.email,
    name: lead.ownerName,
    propertyAddress: lead.address,
  })
});

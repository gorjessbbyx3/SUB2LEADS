🌍 1. Understand the Two Risk Layers
A. City Development Plans
You want to find out if a property is:

In a future rezoning or upzoning area

In a planned development corridor (transit, infrastructure)

Near a future school, mall, or hospital

🛠 Sources:

County planning department GIS portals

Hawaii Office of Planning and Sustainable Development (OPSD)

Zoning amendment proposals (often on city council agendas)

B. Natural Disaster Risk (e.g., Wildfires)
You want to calculate if a property is at increased risk due to:

Wildfire-prone zones

Flood zones (FEMA maps)

Lava zones (Hawai‘i-specific)

Tsunami evacuation areas

Historical disaster frequency

🛠 Sources:

Hawaii State Hazard Mitigation Plan

FEMA Flood Map Service Center

USDA Wildfire Risk Map

USGS Lava Flow Hazard Zones

🧠 2. How to Score It in Sub2Leads
🔧 Add to your Supabase schema (leads table):
sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE leads
ADD COLUMN zoning_change_potential BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN development_zone_risk TEXT DEFAULT 'None',
ADD COLUMN natural_disaster_risk TEXT DEFAULT 'Unknown';
📈 3. Inngest Job: Score Lead Risk
ts
Copy
Edit
// inngest/functions/scoreLeadRisk.ts
import { getLeadLocationData } from "@/lib/db"
import { fetchDisasterRisk, fetchDevelopmentPlans } from "@/lib/risk"

export const scoreLeadRisk = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "score-lead-risk" },
  { event: "lead/created" },
  async ({ event }) => {
    const lead = await getLeadLocationData(event.data.leadId)

    const naturalDisasterRisk = await fetchDisasterRisk(lead.address)
    const developmentPlanInfo = await fetchDevelopmentPlans(lead.address)

    await updateLeadRisk(lead.id, {
      naturalDisasterRisk: naturalDisasterRisk || "Unknown",
      development_zone_risk: developmentPlanInfo?.riskZone || "None",
      zoning_change_potential: developmentPlanInfo?.zoningChange || false,
    })

    return { leadId: lead.id }
  }
)
🔌 4. API/Data Pipeline Ideas
Data Type	Source	How to Use
Wildfire zones	USDA Wildfire API	Match lat/lng and classify
Flood zones	FEMA Flood API	Query zone by address
Lava hazard zones	USGS or Hawaii GIS	Static zone overlays
City zoning plans	County GIS / city open data	Scrape or subscribe to updates
Climate risk (long term)	ClimateCheck, First Street Foundation	Partner or scrape summaries

🧪 Example Output:
A lead might be scored like this:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "zoning_change_potential": true,
  "development_zone_risk": "Transit-Oriented Development",
  "natural_disaster_risk": "High Wildfire Risk"
}
This could affect your:

Lead Score

Buyer targeting

Deal priority
